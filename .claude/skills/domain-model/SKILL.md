description: Build and sharpen La Guardia's domain model – the ubiquitous language in CONTEXT.md, bounded contexts, context map, aggregates/invariants and the logical, stack-neutral data model based on docs/domain/events.yaml. Use when discussing domain terminology, writing or editing CONTEXT.md, or modeling contexts, aggregates and data.

# Domain Modeling

Actively build and sharpen the domain model as you go. This is the *active* discipline: challenging terms, inventing edge-case scenarios, and writing the glossary and the model down the moment they crystallise. (Merely *reading* `CONTEXT.md` for vocabulary is not this skill: that's a one-line habit every skill and agent has. This skill is for when you're changing the model, not just consuming it.)

Architecture decisions (ADRs, tech stack) belong to the `architect` skill. The domain comes first.

## Files

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Glossary (ubiquitous language) | `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root – format: [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md) |
| Event storming model incl. `bounded_contexts`, `aggregates` | `docs/domain/events.yaml` |
| Context map | `docs/domain/context-map.md` |
| Logical data model | `docs/architecture/data-model.md` – template: `templates/data-model.md` |

## 1. Language (during every session)

### Challenge against the glossary
When the user uses a term that conflicts with the existing language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'defect' as X, but you seem to mean Y. Which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language
When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'ticket': do you mean the defect report a visitor files, or the repair job a technician works on? Those are different things."

### Discuss concrete scenarios
When domain relationships are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent scenarios that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about the boundaries between concepts. "A visitor reports 'flipper weak' on a machine that already has an open repair for the same flipper – new defect or the same one?"

### Cross-reference with docs and code
When the user states how something works, check whether `docs/domain/events.yaml`, the stories (and the code, once it exists) agree. If you find a contradiction, surface it.

### Update CONTEXT.md inline
When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up: capture them as they happen. `CONTEXT.md` is totally devoid of implementation details. It is a glossary and nothing else – not a spec, not a scratch pad.

Same word, different meaning in two places → a hint at a bounded context boundary (see 2).

## 2. Bounded Contexts & Context Map
- Draw boundaries along language (same word, different meaning → different context) and responsibility (who decides?).
- `docs/domain/context-map.md`: per context its purpose, core terms, owner role. Relationships as a Mermaid `flowchart` using the patterns Customer/Supplier, Conformist, Anti-Corruption Layer, Shared Kernel, Published Language.
- 2–4 contexts are typical for a small system. More only with justification.
- Maintain them in `events.yaml` under `bounded_contexts`, and group the terms in `CONTEXT.md` by context.

## 3. Aggregates
- An aggregate protects invariants that must be consistent **immediately**. Everything else is eventually consistent via events/policies.
- Keep them small. Reference other aggregates by ID only.
- Per aggregate in `events.yaml`: `context`, `invariants` (as testable statements). Assign commands and events via `aggregate`.
- **An invariant is stated once, on the aggregate** (user, 2026-10-01). A command's `rules` list only what it adds beyond them: defaults, actor permissions no invariant carries, required input, checks across aggregate or context boundaries, and consequences of the transition. Everything the stored state has to satisfy is an invariant, not a rule – the requirements-engineer reads both when deriving scenarios.
- Sign of a wrong aggregate: a command needs data from several aggregates to check a rule.

## 4. Logical Data Model (`docs/architecture/data-model.md`)
- Per aggregate: root entity, entities, value objects, attributes with **domain** types (e.g. `SerialNumber`, `Money`, `Timestamp`), required/optional.
- Lifecycle as a Mermaid `stateDiagram-v2` (derive states from the events).
- Overall view as a Mermaid `erDiagram` (logical, no database types).
- **Traceability**: every attribute comes from the `data` of an event or the `fields` of a read model. Attributes without a source → hotspot.
- Stack-neutral until an ADR decides the stack. After that, a "Physical Model" section may follow.

## 5. Quality Check Before Hand-off
- Every term used in events, commands and stories is in `CONTEXT.md`; no `_Avoid_` term is used anywhere.
- Every event has an aggregate or context, every command a trigger (actor or policy).
- No open hotspots that affect an aggregate or a context boundary – otherwise present them to the user.
- `node .claude/skills/event-storming/scripts/validate-events.ts` passes.
